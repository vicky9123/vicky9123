    <h2>The Gameplay Experience</h2>
    <h3>Collect Capybara Characters</h3>
    <p>The core of Capybara Go is its collection mechanic. Players can "catch" capybaras in various virtual environments. Each capybara character is adorably unique, offering incentives like personality traits, costumes, and even game abilities.</p>
    <p>Much like “Go Diego Go Capybara” episodes foster a love for these gentle creatures, Capybara Go encourages players to appreciate the distinct nature of each new capybara they encounter.</p>

    <h3>Earn Rewards Like “Monopoly Go Capybara” Tokens</h3>
    <p>Capybara Go also has an exciting way to reward your progress through virtual tokens inspired by board games like Monopoly. For example, you can earn "capybara monopoly go" tokens by completing challenges or participating in events. These tokens can be traded for exclusive capybara characters or even in-game accessories.</p>

    <h3>Unlock Virtual Habitats</h3>
    <p>What makes Capybara Go unique is the ability to unlock special habitats modeled on places where capybaras excel, like wetlands or savannahs. Each habitat comes with special challenges—and adorable animations.</p>

    <h3>Tasting Reality Through AR</h3>
    <p>One of the coolest features of Capybara Go is its augmented reality (AR) mode letting you overlay capybaras into your real-world environment. Want to see a capybara lounging on your garden bench? Open the AR mode and watch the magic happen.</p>

    <h3>Casual and Educational Gamification</h3>
    <p>Capybara Go strikes that rare balance between casual fun and educational value. It integrates fun facts within the gameplay, letting players learn about the biology, diet, and natural habitats of capybaras.</p>
